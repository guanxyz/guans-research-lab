Hi, my name is Wei, a PhD student in the Chemical and Biomolecular engineering department.

I am originally from Wuhan, China. I received my BS in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from Lafayette College, where I worked on the heterogeneous catalysis on biodiesel production with Dr. Lindsay Soh.
